# TechDocs Plugin

Welcome to the TechDocs plugin - Spotify's docs-like-code approach built directly into [Backstage](https://backstage.io). Watch [a video of our approach on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFGCaZmA6d4) to learn more.

**WIP: This plugin is a work in progress. It is not ready for use yet. Follow our progress on [the Backstage Discord](https://discord.gg/MUpMjP2) under #docs-like-code or on [our GitHub Milestone](https://github.com/spotify/backstage/milestone/15).**

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](/dev) directory.
